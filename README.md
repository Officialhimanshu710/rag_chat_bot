# 🤖 RAG Chat Bot

A lightweight, high-speed **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application built to chat with multiple **PDFs** and **CSV** files simultaneously.

Unlike traditional RAG applications that rely on heavy Vector Databases (like FAISS or ChromaDB), this project uses a custom **"Smart Context"** algorithm and the **Pure Groq API** to deliver instant answers with zero dependency bloat.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Format Support:** Upload and analyze multiple **PDF** and **CSV** documents at once.
* **Pure Groq Architecture:** Bypasses complex libraries (LangChain) to communicate directly with the **Llama-3-8b** model via Groq, ensuring compatibility with the newest Python versions (3.12/3.13).
* **Smart Context Search:** A custom logic that scans *every* uploaded file individually to find relevant paragraphs, ensuring no document is ignored during the analysis.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Automatically detects and skips corrupted files without crashing the application.
* **Modern UI:** Features a clean, WhatsApp-style chat interface with history tracking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* **AI Model:** [Groq](https://groq.com/) (Llama-3.1-8b-instant)
* **File Processing:** `pypdf`
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
